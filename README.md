# Fluent Mind Landing Page

A minimal React + TypeScript landing page for the **Fluent Mind** online language school.  
Designed as a prototype with Tailwind CSS and Vite. The landing includes:

- A hero section with a call-to-action
- A mission / about section
- A teachers section (initially includes Anastasia Dulich)
- A simple “contact / trial lesson” form (static)
- Fully responsive layout
- Brand colors:  
  `Primary: #2d2764`  
  `Accent:  #bfa371`

> ⚠️ All forms and buttons are currently static and do not send real data. They are placeholders for future integrations (Telegram, WhatsApp, Calendly, email, backend API, etc.)
